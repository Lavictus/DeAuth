DeAuth

This project started of as a deathentication project, hence the name, that proved more difficult then I expected.
Instead I chose to make a Wifi "spammer", which uses the ESP to generate fake acces points.
This shows how easy it is to make something that looks like an acces point, without it actually being one. 
Real life uses for this could be to let someone connect to you instead of the acces point they think they are connecting too,
to steal information.
